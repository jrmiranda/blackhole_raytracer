# Curved Spacetime Raytracer
This project is based on my previous raytracer and extended to a curved spacetime by using an approximation of the Schwarzschild metric, which is a solution for Einstein's field equations that describes gravity in the vicinity of a radially simmetrical distribution of matter, without rotation or charge.
